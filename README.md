# microTensor: Tensor Decomposition for Longitudinal Microbiome Data

This is the package branch for `microTensor`. You can install this 
branch just as a regular R package. The main funciton is 
`microTensor::microTensor` which implements the tensor decomposition
method for longitudinal microbiomes.

To install: from with in R, run 
`devtools::install_github("syma-research/microTensor@package")`

If you are interested in reproducing the analyses performed in our manuscript, 
"A Tensor Decomposition Model For Longitudinal Microbiome Studies", 
by Siyuan Ma and Hongzhe Li, please switch to the "main" branch.
