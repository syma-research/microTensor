# microTensor: Dimension Reduction for Longitudinal Microbiome Data

This repository contains the method implementation and analysis scripts used
for the paper "A Dimension Reduction Model For Longitudinal Microbiome Studies",
by Siyuan Ma and Hongzhe Lee. Directory is organized by:

* `R/` has implementations for used methods in this project, including the proposed
  method, microTensor

* `rmd/` has in order the analyses performed, including data preprocessing,
  simulation, and real-world analyses
  
* `data/` inludes the used datasets
